  ## Data-Structures (Theory)

  ### Arrays 
- Built from fixed-size records
- Constant access time given the index.
- Space efficient â€“ arrays consist only of the data, so no space is wasted with links or formatting info.
- Easy to iterate over quickly, because of memory locality.
- Cannot adjust their size in the middle of a program's execution.
- Dynamic arrays double in size whenever insert index is out of bound (Java's ArrayList is dynamic, while int isn't).
- Java array max length is Integer.MAX_VALUE = 2^31-1 (but could actually be a bit shorter because of reserved memory).
